# To Do

## Improve Simulation

Check the `sim.md` file for more info.

To improve the simulation, we need better photos. Do that.

## Save Tunables

Have an initial tunable that won't get over written. Save to the current file from UI. Also allow the UI to reset to initial.

## Finish Fetchbot 3

Good luck with that. Also maybe get a new name. It's more of an electric cat. How about *artifeloid*? Oh, how about *artificat*?
